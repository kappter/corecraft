## Forge What Lies Beneath.

CoreCraft is a web app for writers who want to build unforgettable characters from the inside out. Using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, it generates a character’s core traits—like strength, shadow, or fracture—and visualizes them as layers, inspired by the Earth’s makeup. With guided questions, you explore their morality, history, and struggles, crafting a deep, tailored foundation for your story in just minutes. It’s the tool that turns a blank page into a living soul.
